Scala Jozi Koans
===========

Overview
--------
A set of simple tests that I put together for the Scala User Group in Johannesburg.
There are greatly inspired by the original [ScalaKoans](http://www.scalakoans.org/), with some minor tweaks.

Requirements
------------
You need [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed on your machine.

You need [Maven 3+](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed and configured on your machine.

Simply clone the repo, and the execute mvn test. This will run all the tests and report the ones which fail.

Using an IDE
------------
You don't have to use an IDE to edit the Koans, a simple text editor will do. However If you want, you can use Eclipse or IntelliJ.

### Using Eclipse for Scala development
Eclipse has a [Scala Plugin](http://scala-ide.org/).

To use the Scala Eclipse IDE with Maven, you need some extra steps explained [here](http://scala-ide.org/docs/tutorials/m2eclipse/index.html). Then simply import the Koans project which is a Maven project.
